# Calculator-Algorithm-Program-Java
This program was done by me to develop my java skills.
I Created a simple calculator which can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication or division depending upon the user input.
I hereby write the algorithm code for my java program to understand easily so that any one can easily access and do my themselves.

Approach Used:

* Take two numbers using the Scanner class. The switch case branching is used to execute a particular section.
* Using a switch case to evaluate respective operations.

Algorithm for my program:
- I import the scanner fuction as it uses to obtain inputs like double,integer etc..
- I declare my class as public so that it could be accessed anywhere we need. 
- I first declare the name for my class so that i can call it anywhere if packages are used.
- I will declare the numbers as double so that i can give any type of values like double,integer.
- I hereby write that Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in) for creating a object.
- After that i want to take input from users so that it can be used if i assigned values it will not be effective.
- Then it will take numbers from users in which i can set number value as double so that i can declare large values and also integer values.
- Now i want to make four basic operations in the user defined numbers
- I need to enter the operator in which what operation can be performed between that two numbers.
- I assign four operators which are + , - , * , /
- I use here switch case operator to perform these operations.
- Use break function so that it will not compile the enter program for your required output. 
- plus(+) operator uses addition of two numbers.
- subtract(-) operator uses subtraction of two numbers.
- star(*) operator uses multiplication of two numbers.
- / operator uses division of two numbers.
- If u enter the values then enter the operator in which operation you want to do between that numbers.
- In case if any problem assigned with user defined operations the system throws "You entered the wrong input" as default one.
- Otherwise it will throws an desired output.
